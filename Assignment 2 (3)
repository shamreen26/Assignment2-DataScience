# Questions 3:

-You have seen in the videos how powerful dictionary data structure is.
-In this assignment, given a number n, you have to write a program that generates a dictionary d which
contains (i, i*i), where i is from 1 to n (both included).
-Then you have to just print this dictionary d.

Example:
Input: 4 will give output as {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
-Input Format:
•Take the number n in a single line.
-Output Format:
•Print the dictionary d in a single line.

Example:
Input:
8
Output:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

my_dictionary = {}
n = int(input())
my_dictionary = dict()

for i in range(1, n+1):
# start and end value
my_dictionary[i] = i*i
print(my_dictionary)


Output :

6
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25,6:36}
